### Hi there, I'm @kernoeb ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **french** developer :fr: !
I've just finished a *DUT Informatique*, and I'm currently in *Licence Pro DLIS*, at the IUT of Vannes, Brittany, France.

I mostly use languages or frameworks such as Node.js, Python3, Java, React.js, React Native and Vue.js ! :)

#### ðŸ”­ Projects

##### BecauseOfProg
About that, Iâ€™m currently working on an **Android** app built in **React Native**, for my programming team that I've been volunteering with for the last 3 years : [BecauseOfProg (Github)](https://github.com/BecauseOfProg/)

We have a website : https://becauseofprog.fr  
And a Discord server : https://discord.becauseofprog.fr

The application allows you to access articles and keep them offline (and there's even a dark theme! :first_quarter_moon_with_face:).

##### Telegram Bots
I'm a big fan of Telegram [@kernoeb](https://t.me/kernoeb), so I built some bots to automate some stuff... :star:

##### Work
I work as an apprentice in a breton start-up company, where I use Node.js and Vue.js.
